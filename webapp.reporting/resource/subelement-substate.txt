When a state encounters a sub-element, it typically pushes a sub-state. In the general
case, this sub-state is not directly specified by the pushing state. Instead, the
pushing state says what it expects, then asks the state factory registry to create
the state.

The element *name* tells the state factory registry what state class is expected. It does
not tell the parent state which role the element plays ("role element names" are often
used in XML, but not here). We are using "type element names", i.e. the element
name says what the element *is*, not *how it is used*.

Content is passed to the sub-state. Attributes can be considered content, thus
attributes should be passed to startState() of the sub-state.
