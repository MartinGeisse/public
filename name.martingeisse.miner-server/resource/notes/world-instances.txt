Instance IDs:
------------------------------------
- Use instance IDs 1, 2, ... for dynamic instances.
- Use instance IDs -1, -2 ... for static instances.
  -1 is the "world".
- Use 0 as an invalid instance ID typed value.

Instance Management
------------------------------------
Table in SQL database that keeps track of existing instances.
(Just ID for now). Will keep the TTL of the instance in the future.

Function to create an instance - allocate ID, *generate World*
-> needs a trigger in the world like a merchant who sells instance access
-> needs an inventory for access token items (instance keys)
