To make this a game:

v1
- achievements
-> simple server action to claim an achievement (no checks, could
   be easily hacked, but better than nothing)
-> save userId, userAuthenticationToken via Java Preferences API
	(java.util.prefs)
-> authentication token not used yet for this API. Just pass userId
   to claim the achievement.
-> need another API to create a user. Returns userId and auth token.

v2
- players should see each other
-> need a better network protocol
-> section downloading / updates / notifications can stay at HTTP
   for now, just player updates via the new protocol, but this
   time the new protocol should be general enough to handle the
   other things too (just not yet).

v3
- currency
-> gain money by mining ores (directly, no inventory)
-> new achievements

v4
- inventory for ores (later: items)
-> stacking?
