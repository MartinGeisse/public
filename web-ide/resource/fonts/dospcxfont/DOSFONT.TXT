----------------------------------DOSFONT-----------------------------------

-INTRODUCTION-
Ever since I bought my PC I have wanted to change that boring font in DOS.
With the dosfont utility I give you the ability to draw your own font.
The program doesn't use up any memory so you can put it in your autoexec.bat
if you like (I did).

-USAGE-
At the DOS-prompt, type  dosfont  followed by the pcx-image containing the
font that you would like to use.
Example: To use the future.pcx font, type like this:
dosfont future.pcx

-DRAWING A FONT-
The characters are 8 pixels wide and 14 pixels high and there are 256
different types. If you look at the future.pcx that followed the exe-file
you'll see 256 sqares. Each square represents a character in the
ASCII-table. If you for example want to change the capital A simply count 
the squares until you come to number 65 and draw the new character with
color nr 1 in that square. Dosfont will notice that there is at least one
pixel with color nr 1 in that square and exchange the normal character for
the new one. All other colors will be ignored and a square without any pixel
of color 1 will leave that character unchanged.
If you don't understand take a look at future.pcx and I think you'll get the
hang of it.

-COPYING-
Dosfont is POSTCARDWARE.
This means that you can copy it freely as long as the files are not changed 
nor left out.
However if you use dosfont you have to send me a postcard to this address:

 Martin Magnusson
  ™stg”tagatan 5
382-31 Nybro Sweden

-INFORMATION-
Dosfont is written in Borland Pascal 7.0 by Martin Magnusson.
The included font future.pcx was also done by Martin Magnusson in 
Deluxe Paint 2 Enhanced.

---------------HAVE FUN and don't forget to send a postcard!----------------
