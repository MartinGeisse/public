The goal of this project is to build a typesetting library in Java, using the algorithms from TeX.

The goal is NOT:
- to implement TeX's macro language
- to be as fast or memory efficient

Further consequences:
- any error causes typesetting to stop
- problems such as overfull boxes should be reported through some error reporting interface,
	but not cause error output on a console
