NOTE - According to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt ':' is not a valid
       character in URL and must be encoded. 
       In order for Wicket to produce valid URLs I've decided to use - as separator instead
       This will only affect listener URLs anyway, which are not shown in location bar 
       (except for bookmarkable listeners on stateless pages)
       '-' in component name is encoded as '--'.


NOT BOOKMARKABLE
----------------

Page Instance - Render (RenderPageRequestHandler)
/wicket/page?2

Page Instance - Listener (ListenerInterfaceRequestHandler)
/wicket/page?2-5.click-foo-bar-baz   (5 is render count)

Page Instance - Listener with behavior (ListenerInterfaceRequestHandler) 
/wicket/page?2-5.click.1-foo-bar-baz   (5 is render count, 1 is behavior index)

BOOKMARKABLE - NOT MOUNTED
--------------------------

Page Class - Render (BookmarkablePageRequestHandler)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid (RenderPageRequestHandler for pages that were created using bookmarkable URLs)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2

Page Instance - Bookmarkable Listener (BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestHandler)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2-5.click-foo-bar-baz (5 is renderCount)
/wicket/bookmarkable/org.apache.wicket.MyPage?2-5.click.1-foo-bar-baz (5 is renderCount, 1 is behavior index)
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)

BOOKMARKABLE - MOUNTED
----------------------

Page Class - Render (BookmarkablePageRequestHandler for mounted pages)
/mount/point
/mount/point?pageMap
(these will redirect to hybrid alternative if page is not stateless)

Page Instance - Render Hybrid (RenderPageRequestHandler for mounted pages) 
/mount/point?2

Page Instance - Bookmarkable Listener (BookmarkableListenerInterfaceRequestHandler for mounted pages) 
/mount/point?2-5.click-foo-bar-baz (5 is render count)
/mount/point?2-5.click.1-foo-bar-baz (5 is render count, 1 is behavior index)
(these will redirect to hybrid if page is not stateless)

mount path can also contain parameter placeholders
e.g. when mount path is /foo/${bar}/baz and the incoming url is /foo/abc/baz   the extracted page parameters will 
contain named parameter bar="abc".

RESOURCES
