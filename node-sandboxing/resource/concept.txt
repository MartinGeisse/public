- need a sample application that can be customized
	- shopping system -> too complicated
	- chat application (web + socket.io)?
	- customization:
		- toolbar
		- content objects

- write a few customizations
	- chat: add boldface (previous: only plaintext)
	- chat: quote previous message from other user
	- chat: drag'n'drop image

- explain: architecture problems (nur kurz, das ist nicht der Kern)
	system must be prepared to accept such customizations
	
- need for sandboxing
	- server-installed plugins from untrusted sources
		- this is going to be a problem, even with sandboxing
	- client-installed plugins (sources & client untrusted)
		- even more of a problem
	-->
	upper limit on usefulness for plugins from untrusted sources!
	- cannot give sensitive data to untrusted code

- sandboxing

- workarounds for problems with untrusted code
	- handles instead of data
	-->
	if the customization code is untrusted, then more customization
	implies more handling code on the "trusted" side
