Translations for all languages in database
DB contains the definitive data, everything else is derived from the DB
.po files can be derived from the DB contents and downloaded via API
Cake app: updates .po files from the API after live update
Cake app dev: updates .po files from the API on request (update-translations action that only works in DEV)

authentication:
- generic access for devs
- restricted access (single language only) for specific users
-> both cases: redirect to URL from the translation system, POSTing an access token that grants specific
	access rights to the user's session. Does NOT impose a session (fixation vulnerability)

Provide PHP lib for
- UI access (POSTing the access token, redirecting, etc. -- helper methods only, since the exact mechanism
	for redirecting is framework-specific)
- downloading a .po file

- global key: domain, message key, language key
- uses "programmer's locale" as the original
	- store previous, current original for display
- message_string_original_plural(_previous),
	message_string_2, message_string_3, message_string_4
	plural=1, use_fallback=1
	comment
		--> seems like this is never used
- support soft-delete

- what's the use of the "word count"?
- what's the use of the "is in admin review" flag?
- what's the use of the "translation status"?
- what's the use of the "todo"?
- what's the use of the "changed"?
- what's the use of the "review requested"?
