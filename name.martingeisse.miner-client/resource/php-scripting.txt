Idea: Use PHP as a scripting language for Miner, because there's a lot of PHP programmers
"out there" that might have good ideas for the game, even though PHP doesn't fit that
niche well.

Should be usable for server and client scripting; should not require a server restart.
The scripts should be stored on the server and be downloadable, so the client fetches
all scripts it needs.

This might also be useful as a secondary project next to miner that also uses Stack'd,
and is oriented towards game "matches" instead of a persistent world. Name suggestion:
"Stackerspace"; connects to "Stack'd" and also reminds of the "playground" nature of
the game.

Server usage:
Each server has a list of games running. To start a new game, point to the game description
file (JSON) which also links to PHP scripts, assets etc. Clients will download all
required assets and cache using a file hash.

Should the server load all files to a private area to guard against later modification?
Probably not -> overpowered. Just load the game description file once, and guard against
modification of *that*.

Each game type would be represented as a folder with a game.json file that is the game
description file.
