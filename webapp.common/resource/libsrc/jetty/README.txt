This is a source checkout of the Jetty webserver.

To build, use:

  mvn clean install

The jetty distribution will be built in

  jetty-distribution/target/distribution

The first build may take a long time as Maven downloads all the
dependencies.

The tests do a lot of stress testing, and on some machines it is
necessary to set the file descriptor limit to greater than 2048
for the tests to all pass successfully.

Bypass tests by building with -Dmaven.test.skip=true but note
that this will not produce some test jars that are leveraged
in other places in the build.
