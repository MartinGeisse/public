This package contains cache loader implementations that fetch values using QueryDSL queries.
For each implementation, the whole cache loader is associated with a database table.

Features provided by these classes include:
- cache entries may represent single rows or row lists. Lists accept an order specifier.
- cache entries may be the query result, or may be generated by a transformation method
  from the query result. This method is implemented in concrete subclasses of the
  abstract classes in this package. For row list based caches, the transformation
  may map a row list to an output value list, but may also add global information
  that applies to all rows reutrned for a specific cache key.
- NOT YET:
  row list based caches may provide a "window" into the list of (direct or transformed)
  rows, i.e. limit and offset parameters. In this case, the cache value must be a
  list of values -- otherwise, limit/offset do not make sense -- that is, no global
  information outside the transformed row list may be added to cache values).
  Caches of this type also support fetching the rows in a block-granular way, storing
  each block separately in the cache.

Apart from the {@link RelationalPath} that specifies the table to fetch
from, fetching is based on a key expression and a set of additional predicates.
The value fetched for the cache key 'cacheKey' is based on a query with the condition:

	((cacheKey == keyExpression) && additionalPredicates)

The keyExpression could be the table ID or other unique value (for single-row based caches)
or any other value (type/status/whatever) for row list based caches.

The additionalPredicates determine which rows are visible to the cache at all. For example,
many systems support a "soft delete" flag that marks rows as deleted while still keeping
them in the database, for example to avoid foreign key violations. The additionalPredicates
would then exclude soft-deleted rows from the cache.

The classes in this package connect to the database using the {@link EntityConnectionManager}.
