/**
 * Represents packets that are sent between client and server.
 * The packet consists of header data (including the packet
 * type) and a body that is treated as a buffer by this class.
 * 
 * Conceptually, header and body are separate. Implementation-wise
 * this class uses a single buffer that contains the body and
 * leaves room for header fields. For received packets, the
 * header data is stored redundantly in the buffer and the fields
 * of this class. For sent packets, this class encodes the header
 * fields into the buffer when sending.
 *
 * The packet type tells which kind of packet this is. Packet
 * types are 16-bit unsigned integers (0x0000 through 0xFFFF),
 * with packet types in the range 0xFF00 through 0xFFFF being
 * reserved for special protocol packets.
 * 
 * The total packet size (and thus buffer size) must not
 * exceed 255 bytes.
 * 
 * Wire format for a packet:
 * - body size (unsigned byte)
 * - type (unsigned short)
 * - body (bytes)
 * 
 * When sending a packet, the readable bytes determine the
 * packet's contents (header and body), with the header being
 * assembled in the buffer on-the-fly.
 * 
 * When receiving a packet, the header is consumed by the
 * receiver logic and the readable bytes are set up to contain
 * the packet body.
