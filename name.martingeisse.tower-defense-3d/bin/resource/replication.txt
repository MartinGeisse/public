Problem: programming a simple new feature like faction score, divine power and
spells is a significant amount of work:
- server-side data storage (SQL), not too hard
- client-side GUI, should be not too hard
- network protocol, synchronization of the values -- cumbersome and sync is hard
- server-side logic

Use generic system for this?

initial idea: simplifies development -- only have to modify server
code, not network code and client code. Also simplifies deployment
of new features.

- Replicated Object, e.g. NPC
- non-uniform replicated object, e.g. player
- Replicated Variable, e.g. faction score
- non-uniform replicated variable, e.g. player money
- GUI replication (only replicated to a single session) (?)

-> should simplify network code and manual synchronization
