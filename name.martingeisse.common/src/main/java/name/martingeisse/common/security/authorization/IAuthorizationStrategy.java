/**
 * This strategy serves two purposes:
 * - to determine a user's permissions based on his/her identity, known properties,
 *   and supplied credentials
 * - to determine whether a specific request for permission is granted for a
 *   permissions set
 * 
 * After a user has authenticated, we have the information needed to determine
 * his/her granted permissions:
 * - the supplied credentials
 * - a (possibly empty) set of trusted properties of the user
 * - if determined successfully, the user's identity
 * 
 * Note that if the user's identity has been authenticated successfully, then the
 * initial set of properties is discarded and the user's up-to-date and complete
 * properties are loaded using the identity and passed as user properties.
 * 
 * Based on this information, an {@link IPermissions} object is created that
 * represents the user's set of granted permissions within the application.
 * This object is opaque to the framework, therefore this strategy is also
 * needed to check specific requests for permission.
