Parameterized model URLs (using old syntax here):
	<gui:model id="customerData" src="/api/customer/${customerId}/data" type="json">

HTML include (currently: only text)

Panels with models (using old syntax here):
	<gui:panel src="/gui/customer-name-panel.xml" model="customerData" />

use own namespace for model providers with model: prefix (?)
	-> depends on how many different providers there actually are

forms:

	<!-- and finally, a form! -->
	<!-- This GUI server system defines that fields are *read* from models, but changing data
		happens by sending forms / commands without touching models. Internally, the system
		uses models that connect to a form data object, and if validation is successful,
		sends that data to the business logic. Connecting models to form components only
		initializes the components with values from the models, but it cannot write data back. -->
	<gui:form method="POST" action="/admin/customer/sendMail">
	
		<!-- default is required=true, trim=true -->
		<gui:form.text name="subject" label="Subject Line" required="true" trim="true">
		
			<!-- doesn't make sense for a subject line, just for demonstration -->
			<gui:normalize id="lowercase">
			
			<!-- some validation (only some make sense for a subject line) -->
			<gui:validate id="string" minLength="3" maxLength="50" regex="foo[^a-zA-Z]+" glob="foo*" />
			
			<!-- place keyboard focus here -->
			<gui:focus />
			
		</gui:form.text>

		<!-- another field that takes its default value from a model -->
		<gui:form.text name="targetAddress" label="Target Address" model="customerData" field="contact.email" />
		
		<!-- another field that assembles its default value -->
		<gui:form.textarea name="message" label="Message">
			<gui:value>
				Dear <gui:panel src="/gui/customer-salutation-with-name-panel.xml" model="customerData" />,
				
				<!-- this defines where the initial cursor is for this field, but without initial focus, this
					doesn't have any effect until the component is focused. Also it has no effect if the
					user overrides the cursor position with a mouse click, only when changing focus without
					overriding the cursor position (i.e. with the tab key) -->
				<gui:cursor />
				
				Yours,
				<gui:panel src="/gui/shop-employee-panel.xml" model="adminUser" />
				
				<gui:panel src="/gui/email-footer.xml" />
			</gui:value>
		</gui:form.textarea>
