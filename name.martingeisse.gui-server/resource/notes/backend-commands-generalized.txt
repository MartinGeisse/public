"using backend commands everywhere":

Links do not link to URLs nor to pages. Links fire backend commands when
clicked. (name -> "GUI commands" ?)

A link may fire a backend command to open a page. A link that only fires
a single "open page" command gets rendered as a "simple URL" link.

A link may fire other commands. This generates "javascript links",
"AJAX links" and "wicket component links".

A link may fire a request to the backend, and the backend responds with
commands. This gets implemented as an AJAX link or wicket component links.
Further effects depend on the response from the backend.

OPEN QUESTION: when to use AJAX links; when to use wicket component links.
