BookmarkableEntityInstanceNavigationHandler Links will look for the page's IGetEntityId
interface or "id" page parameter to determine the entity ID if none is set in the
link's page parameters explicitly.

Extend this to look in the whole component hierarchy, starting at the link and moving
up to the page, checking for IGetEntityId (components do not have individual page
parameters), and check the page parameters last. This is yet another simplification
to obtain the entity ID and might save some memory as well.
