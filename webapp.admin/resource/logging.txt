Some logging ideas:

Allow inspection for the application configuration. Logging is
for processes, inspection pages are for structure. I.e. log the
startup process, but structure is less important there since it
won't change and can be inspected at runtime.

Add per-session logging switches. This might be as easy as
dynamically reconfiguring log4j for each request based on session
values. (<-- simplest thing that could possibly work!)
